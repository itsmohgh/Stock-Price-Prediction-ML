# Stock-Price-Prediction-ML
This repository showcases a stock price prediction project for 'Iran Kh. Inv.' using Gradient Boosting Regressor, along with the incorporation of technical indicators. The project aims to forecast future stock prices based on historical data and analyze the model's accuracy using Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and R-squared Score.

## installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction.git

Install the required dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

## Usage
The project consists of the following main components:

## Data
The historical stock data is stored in a CSV file (Iran Kh. Inv..csv). Data preprocessing steps, including data cleaning and scaling, are performed before training the model.

## Model Training: 
The Gradient Boosting Regressor model is initialized and trained on the preprocessed data to predict stock prices.

## Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and R-squared Score.

## Data
The stock data used in this project is sourced from the tsetmc database and is stored in a CSV file (Iran Kh. Inv..csv). The data includes historical stock prices and date information.

## Model Training
The stock price prediction model is built using the Gradient Boosting Regressor from scikit-learn. The model is trained on the preprocessed data to learn patterns and trends in stock prices.

### Visualization
The project includes visualizations of the actual stock prices and the corresponding predicted prices using matplotlib. These visualizations help in understanding the model's predictive capabilities.
